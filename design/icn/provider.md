# ICN provider contract

ICN implements Magnitude's `local` AI provider. Generic provider and agent code sees an ordinary
provider model ID and `BoundModel`; it does not see packages, downloads, assessments, serving plans,
or runtime residency.

## Provider offerings

The local provider adapter projects each currently resolved model serving configuration as one
offering containing a stable local provider model ID and that exact configuration. Both the
configuration and offering are derived rather than persisted.

ACN resolves configurations and capabilities from issued catalog entries or installed package
inspection plus the canonical standard-profile rule. Catalog capabilities describe an uninstalled
offering. Once the effective target package has a completed inspection, that inspection is
authoritative because it describes the artifact inference will actually execute. When neither
source can establish capabilities, the offering remains disabled with conservative metadata rather
than claiming support.

Within the separate `local` provider namespace, the provider model ID is exactly the serving
configuration ID. ACN never prefixes or hashes package or profile data to create another identity.

An offering exists independently of current installation, assessment, slot selection, or residency.
ACN's local-offering projection combines the resolved configuration with installed-package and assessment
observations to produce the provider model catalog entry. This is the only place that derives local
provider availability. When ICN can assess the exact configuration, that catalog entry carries the
complete per-domain memory accounting unchanged: capacity, required allocation, compatibility
reserve, and remaining assessment headroom. The local-model product projection consumes that
availability and derives application memory guidance from assessment, normalized hardware, and
resident allocation evidence on the same model row. Provider offerings do not carry application
warning policy, parallel aggregate fields, or capacity labels. Generic and cloud provider entries
do not fabricate local memory accounting.
Provider catalog presentation keeps the base display name and optional variant label as separate
fields. The local adapter derives both through the same ACN resolver used by the local-model product
projection; generic provider and agent code treat the label as presentation only.

Initial and invalidation-driven projection runs in one scoped background task. ICN-side assessment
never gates ACN service readiness.

The local-offering projection consumes the shared per-configuration assessment state; it never
invokes assessment. Package notifications may change offering availability, while the
separate local-model assessor decides assessment admission from semantic assessment keys.
Download progress may update product acquisition presentation but cannot transition an offering's
configuration to `Assessing`.

The aggregate provider catalog remains usable when aggregation completes with typed provider or
catalog failures. Such a snapshot is `Degraded`, including when every successful source contributes
an empty model list; an empty result does not turn a partial provider failure into aggregate
unavailability.

Catalog refresh is catalog-owned shared work. Equivalent callers join one refresh; conflicting
targeted refreshes serialize. Every Effect `Exit` publishes a terminal Ready, Degraded, or
Unavailable snapshot before releasing ownership, so caller loss cannot strand `Refreshing`.

Product visibility and grouping belong to
[Local-model product projection](../model-management/local-model-product-projection.md). The provider
adapter contributes one offering facet for each resolved configuration; it does not decide whether
a product row exists. Bundle identity is its tagged structure and ordered package identities.
Provider model IDs continue to distinguish exact configurations.

## Selection and resolution

A slot selection contains only provider ID, provider model ID, and reasoning effort. It references
an offering rather than copying its configuration.

Model-slot availability preserves incomplete authority as `Pending`. A configured slot remains
pending while its provider-catalog identity is unresolved or, for a local selection, while local
offerings or installed-package inventory are not yet authoritative. Agent configuration derives
the same lifecycle from the slot instead of reconstructing dependency readiness. A turn waits
interruptibly on its coherent configuration-and-toolkit projection without delaying message
publication. Once the observation terminalizes, a ready slot runs normally and a genuinely
unassigned or unavailable slot produces the typed `ModelNotReady` turn outcome; initialization is
never reported as an agent defect.

The ACN slot boundary normalizes reasoning effort before persistence: it preserves a supported
requested effort and otherwise selects the provider model's default. Stored selections are
normalized through the same operation when the catalog becomes available. The client and agent do
not independently repair reasoning effort.

The local provider resolver maps the selected provider model ID to the exact current catalog or
standard configuration. Provider binding is cheap and has no runtime side effect. Temporary
authority failure preserves the selection as unavailable. A complete authoritative projection
that lacks the identity clears the selection; neither case chooses another configuration.

Existing recency-based slot substitution remains product behavior. It operates on stable provider
model IDs and does not create, reassess, or rewrite offerings.

## Explicit instances

ICN owns one `ModelInstanceController` and currently permits at most one Ready local instance.

ACN's `ModelSlotController` is the product intent authority. A manual load and local request
preparation use the same canonical slot and instance observation:

1. resolve the selected configuration through its current provider offering;
2. require all bundle packages to be installed;
3. create a fresh `ModelInstanceId` and submit the exact configuration to ICN;
4. bind the slot after admission and observe that exact instance to Ready; and
5. start chat with that exact instance ID and configuration.

The submitted configuration fixes per-request context capacity. ICN independently resolves the
resident parallel allocation and reports it as load execution evidence; ACN does not persist or
select that allocation.

Loading another configuration replaces the singleton residency through the same serialized
transition. ACN creates a branded model-instance identity before loading and ICN preserves it
through loading and residency. One Stop operation addresses only that exact identity, whether it is
still loading or already resident, and waits for partial cleanup or active generation leases to
drain. A delayed Stop cannot affect a newer instance of the same configuration.

ICN chat never loads, configures, or selects a model. A chat request for a configuration that is
not resident fails without mutating runtime state.

## Concurrency and lifetime

The ICN `ModelInstanceController` is the sole mutation and lease authority.

- Load, Stop, and replacement mutations serialize.
- Equivalent instance admissions are idempotent; caller interruption never cancels admitted work.
- A projected Loading or Stopping lifecycle always has a matching live ICN owner.
- An identical load is idempotent after current state is rechecked.
- Replacement closes new admission and waits for existing generation leases.
- A completion holds one generation lease until its body completes, fails, or is canceled.
- A failed mutation does not poison later attempts.
- Unexpected loss of the resident serving container is observed with the configuration identity and
  becomes a typed blocked slot state; it is not inferred from generic provider unavailability.

ACN rechecks the attributed slot and exact instance after preparation. Progress and terminal state
come from `ModelInstancesSnapshot`; the load response stream is never the lifecycle authority.

## Prompt and request boundary

The provider follows the shared [native Chat Completions contract](../ai/native-chat-completions.md).
It uses the shared request builder and encoder before adding the bound model-instance identity. The
generated ICN client then validates the local extension and transports it. ICN validates structural
inputs before accepting a stream and validates tokenizer-dependent constraints under the resident
lease.

Local-model preparation is a scoped agent-request phase injected by ACN. It resolves and observes
the exact Ready instance, then installs an Effect fiber-local instance binding for the provider
request. The local provider refuses to encode a request without that binding. ICN atomically
acquires the exact `ModelInstanceLease`; no ACN residency-admission bridge exists.

Context admission uses the resident configuration's context length. Catalog metadata, compaction,
load planning, and request admission must agree on that exact configuration.

ICN lifecycle control chunks are process-local request observations, not assistant output. The
local provider removes them before the provider-neutral response codec and forwards queue, prefill,
and generation-start state through optional request attribution. ACN's preceding preparation phase
uses that same progress sink, so the display sees one continuous request lifecycle. A failed or
canceled start clears preparation progress; after acceptance, ending, failing, or canceling the
response stream clears provider-owned progress. Providers that do not support granular observation
remain valid and expose no synthetic progress.

ICN also publishes one final cumulative timing snapshot for every accepted generation. The local
provider translates its generated-token count, decode duration, decode rate, and time to
first token into the optional provider-neutral generation-performance contract. This final
measurement is independent of transient request progress and requires no per-token timing stream.
Generic agent code consumes the optional capability without branching on the local provider ID.

## Speculative decoding

A speculative-decoding bundle is explicit in the offering's configuration, including its method
and embedded or separate draft source. ACN does not attach, remove, or infer a draft or method
during provider resolution or chat.

Speculative decoding is unavailable and says so rather than reporting a disabled configuration that
was never considered: no EIM serving profile declares any speculative argument. A servable bundle is
therefore always a single package, and the draft-source and method contract types remain in the
protocol for stability while being unreachable.

## Failure behavior

- Selected identity absent from an authoritative offering projection: ACN clears the selection.
- Incomplete catalog, local-offering, or installed-package-inventory authority: agent slot
  resolution remains pending and turn execution waits without a timeout.
- Missing package: the provider catalog entry and slot are unavailable; chat does not trigger a
  download.
- Configuration no longer fits or is incompatible: the provider catalog entry is disabled and load
  fails with the typed ICN result.
- ICN unavailable or malformed response: ACN preserves the dependency/transport failure.
- Nonresident chat: ICN rejects it without a load side effect.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every local provider call resolves through one exact current configuration and one read-only
  provider projection.
- Runtime load receives the resolved ICN configuration unchanged.
- Local availability is derived in one ACN projection.
- Provider projection consumes assessment state and never admits assessment work.
- Provider availability never determines local-model product visibility.
- A completed aggregate catalog with provider failures is degraded even when it contains no models.
- Every assessed local provider catalog entry exposes ICN's complete per-domain memory accounting
  for that exact serving configuration.
- Provider binding does not load a model.
- Local preparation is not represented as a provider response or provider failure.
- Preparation admission remains held until ICN accepts the request's generation lease.
- Chat cannot mutate residency.
- Slot selection and recency refer only to stable provider model IDs.
- Speculative method and embedded/separate draft composition are identical during assessment, load,
  and inference.
